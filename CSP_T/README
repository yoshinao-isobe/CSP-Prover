1 Introduction 

CSP-Prover [1] provides a deep encoding of the process algebra CSP
within the interactive theorem prover Isabelle. It has a generic
architecture divided into a large reusable part independent of
specific CSP models and an instantiated part for each specific CSP
model.

This package "CSP_T" provides the instantiated part for the traces
model T. It defines the domain "domT" together with proofs in Isabelle
which establish that domT indeed are complete metric spaces as well as
complete partial orders. Furthermore, it define the semantic clauses
of the model T. Finally, a model-dependent proof infrastructure for
the model T is provided, thus CSP-laws such as step laws as well as
distributive laws, or tactics such as cspT_hsf_tac that translates CSP
expressions into Head Sequential Form.
