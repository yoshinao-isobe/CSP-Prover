CSP-Prover is tested by the following small examples. All the examples
need the package "CSP_F", thus start Isabelle/jEdit by

   isabelle jedit -d '$CSP_PROVER_HOME' -l CSP_F

then, apply the proof script in each example.

(1) Test_proof.thy

A simple equality is proven by three different ways, thus semantical
proof, manually synatctical proof, and semi-atuomatical synatctical
proof. You should check this example at first.

   isabelle jedit -d '$CSP_PROVER_HOME' -l CSP_F Test_proof.thy

(2) Test_Buffer.thy

This example is used in the User-Guide, to explain how to express
recursive processes and verify the refinement.

(3) Test_infinite.thy

The refinement relation between processes with infinite states is
verified.

(4) Test_renaming.thy

This shows small examples with renaming.
