1 Introduction 

The deadlock freeness of Kung's systolic array for the multiplication
of n x n matrices is verified by DFP (Deadlock Freedom Proof) package
on CSP-Prover.

2 Theory files

SA_definition.thy : Definition of the Kung's systolic array
SA_local.thy      : Possible local connections are checked
SA_condition.thy  : Simple conditions such as triple_disjoint are checked
SA_expanding.thy  : Semantics (Failures set) of Systolic array is checked
SA_main.thy       : Deadlock freedom is verified by Rule1_Roscoe_Dathi_1987_I

3 How to use these theory files

Execute Isabelle/jEdit as follows:

   isabelle jedit -d '$CSP_PROVER_HOME' -l DFP SA_main.thy
