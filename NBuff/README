1 Introduction

The theory file NBuff.thy proves that LinkBuff is failures-equivalent
to Buff N by induction on N, where

  Buff N is a specification of buffer whose capacity is N, and
  LinkBuff is concurrent system which consists of N copies of Buff 1

The proof strategy is based on the proof given in Section 3.3 in

  Robin Milner, Communication and Concurrency, Prentice Hall, 1989.
