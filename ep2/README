1 Introduction 

The ep2 system is a new industrial standard of electronic payment
systems. It consists of seven autonomous entities centred around the
ep2 Terminal: Cardholder (i.e., customer), Point of Service (i.e.,
cash register), Attendant, POS Management System, Acquirer, Service
Center, and Card. These entities communicate with the Terminal and, to
a certain extent, with one another via XML-messages in a fixed format.
These messages contain information about authorisation, financial
transactions, as well as initialisation and status data. The state of
each component heavily depends on the content of the exchanged data.

A part of ep2 can be verified by CSP-Prover. The detail is explained
in the following page:
