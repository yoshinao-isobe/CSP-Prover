1 Introduction 

These 5 theory files (DM1_Sys_def.thy - DM5_Spc_Seq.thy) verify that
(Imp n) refines Spc (i.e. Spc <=F (Imp n)). (Imp n) expresses a
concurrent behavior between two mathematicians and a shared variable,
where n is the initial value of the shared variable. On the other
hand, Spc requires that the mathematicians exclusively eat and they
have no deadlock. Please also see the following URL:

2 Theory files

  DM1_Imp_def.thy  : defines Imp
  DM2_para.thy     : expands parallel operators in Imp
  DM3_hide.thy     : expands hiding operators in Imp
  DM4_Spc_def.thy  : defines Spc
  DM5_Spc_Imp.thy  : proves Spc <=F Imp


3 How to use these theory files

Execute Isabelle/jEdit as follows:

   isabelle jedit -d '$CSP_PROVER_HOME' -l CSP_F DM5_Spc_Imp.thy
